# Who is this damn idiot?
I'm an engineer.
  
Originally trained in mechanical engineering I worked in the automotive industry for a few years doing design and development work for Ford and Jaguar back in the late 90's.  

That was all a bit slow for me and so I went back to university to do an MSc in Computer Science and I have been working as a software developer and architect ever since.

As an engineer through and through I look on the world with a critical eye.
This is site just me venting about stuff I have seen both good and bad.
