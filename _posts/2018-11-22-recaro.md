# Recaro Nonza Nova 2

## Short version
I don't think this car child seat is safe. I returned it and bought something else. 


## Long version
I recently bought a Recaro Monza Nova 2 Seatfix and after using it just 3 times it has broke due to what appears to be a serious design flaw.

The expended polystyrene (EPS) insert for the headrest extends beyond the plastic body of the headrest but is not tied back in anyway.  Therefore any force applied to the side of the headrest will result in a large leverage effect on the bend of the polystyrene which therefore snaps.  This is precisely what my 3 year old son did the 3rd time he climbed out of the seat.  An adult leaning into the car could easily do the same thing.
You can see what I mean here.

Here we have a weak material (the EPS), a relatively large leverage as the very front of the headrest is the bit sticking out, and finally a tight bend in the material providing a stress concentration point.  These are basic principles that any undergraduate engineer would be aware of.


What is clearly needed is some sort of tie back to the plastic on the end of the EPS insert as can be seen here on the Britax Evolva seat that we have in our second car.  As you can see all it takes is a bit of strong tape in the correct position. It's even more obvious on the Cybex S-Fix that I have replaced the Recaro with. Note the 'Do not remove' text all over the tape!

Now let’s be clear here.  If you never apply pressure to the end of the headrest then it’ll be fine.  However, if you use this seat in an environment where there are children climbing over it or where you may have to reach into the car and lean against it then this will get broken.  Sound familiar?


Once the headrest insert is broken then the only thing holding the side piece in place is the stretchy fabric over the top.  In an accident I guess it might stay in place, or it might not but are you really prepared to take that chance with the life of your child?  I certainly am not.  If this happened to the inside of my bike crash helmet then I would replace it immediately and I value the head of my son far more than my own. 

Facing the possibility of throwing an otherwise brand new seat in the bin was annoying, but after contacting [www.uberkids.com](www.uberkids.com), where I bought it, about the problem they immediately offered collection and a full refund. Well done Uberkids.  I just hope that they can pass on any incurred cost to Recaro who are clearly at fault.  

In my mind this is a safety issue.  This seat is not fit for purpose as it will break in the environment in which it is intended to be used.

….which is all rather a shame as it is otherwise a good looking group 2/3 car seat that my son tells me is comfortable and on paper has some nice features.  If you are prepared to dismantle it on purchase and apply some tape of the correct type to fix the problem then I’m sure it will serve you well but should you really have to?  

No.  

Simply buy something else.  There are plenty of safer alternatives.
